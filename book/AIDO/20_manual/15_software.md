# Software requirements {#cm-sw status=ready}


This section describes the required software to participate in the competition.


## Supported platforms {#cm-sw-supported}


### Ubuntu 16 

Ubuntu 16 is the best supported environment.

### Ubuntu 18

Ubuntu 18 is the second best supported environment.

The reason it's not the first is that sometimes there 
is some confusion regarding Python 2 vs Python 3.

### Mac OS X

OS X is well supported; however we don't have full instructions
for certain steps. There is so much divergence in how OS X environments are configured.
