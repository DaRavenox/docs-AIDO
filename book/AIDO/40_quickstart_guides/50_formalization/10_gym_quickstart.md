This is a tutorial on how to make a submission for the **LF**
(lane following on a closed course) and **LFV** (lane following
with dynamic obstacles) AIDO challenge. This challenge uses
the gym-duckietown environment from https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown
but packs it up in a docker container.

To this end the `gym-duckietown` environment lives in one
container called `gym-duckietown-server`. The code for the agent that
**you** as the participant have to modify as well as the code for
communicating with the `-server` container live in a different
repository called `gym-duckietown-agent`. We will guide you
through the process of installing everything, forking this repo,
modifying the code and making a submission.

**TL;DR**
There are two containers:

- `gym-duckietown-server`, runs the actual gym environment
- `gym-duckietown-agent`, hold the agent code (i.e. your code)

We provide scripts for pulling, building and launching both containers.

## Prerequisites

Currently we support development on Mac and Linux. We are working on supporting Windows soon.

Please make sure you have the following installed on your PC:

- [Docker CE](https://docs.docker.com/install/) for running the containers
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) for starting both `server` and `agent` and make them communicate with each other in one command
- Some Python code editor for modifying the agent. We'd recommend [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) for pulling the repositoy.

## Install

Point your browser to this URL: https://github.com/duckietown/gym-duckietown-agent, click the `Fork` button (top right) and then click your Github account when it asks you where you want to fork to.

<figure id='screen-gym-fork'>
<figcaption></figcaption>
<img src="screenshots/screenshot-gym-duckietown-agent-fork2.png" class='diagram' style="width:100%"/>
</figure>

Now you should see the page of your forked repo. Now let's clone that new repo. Click the green `Clone or Download` button (right side), copy the URL, open a terminal and clone your repo

    git clone https://github.com/[YOUR GITHUB USERNAME HERE]/gym-duckietown-agent.git

That's it for the "installation" part. :)

## Run

Change into the directoy of you `gym-duckietown-agent`

    cd gym-duckietown-agent

and launch both containers with this command

    docker-compose pull && docker-compose up

What this will do:

- Pull the latest `gym-duckietown-server` container from dockerhub (this is as of writing `1.9GB` and can take a bit to download) and run it
- Build the agent into a container (including installing dependencies within the container) and run it

Both of these actions should only take a bit longer on the first start. On consecutive starts this should be faster.

In the process of starting both containers you should see this:

<figure id='screen-gym-start'>
<figcaption></figcaption>
<img src="screenshots/screenshot-gym-duckietown-agent-startup.png" class='diagram' style="width:100%"/>
</figure>

Then the two containers should run for a few seconds, generating steps and simulating the results. After that's done, you should see the final verdict, the average reward over 10 episodes in the terminal:

<figure id='screen-gym-end'>
<figcaption></figcaption>
<img src="screenshot-gym-duckietown-agent-end.png" class='diagram' style="width:100%"/>
</figure>

This second to last line (the one with `The average reward of 10 episodes was -50.7127. Best epi....`) - that's your self-evaluation. That's how you measure your own performance. You should try to get this number as high as possible, but also keep in mind that there is always some randomness involved. So even if you run this twice without changing anything, the number can change quite a lot. Later in development you can modify how many episodes are averaged so that you get a better estimate. Currently that's 10 but that's quite low.

## Seeing the Policy in Action aka Visual Debugging

If you want to see what the Duckiebot move around, the easiest way to do so is by running the `agent` code without a container (i.e. on your local machine). In order to do that, first install the `gym-duckietown-agent` package locally (in a terminal):

You need `python3` installed, as well as `pip3` and we assume you have sudo access the machine.

    # assuming your current shell is
    # in the directoy "gym-duckietown-agent"
    sudo pip3 install -e .

If you don't have sudo access, you can run the code without the `sudo` and with `--user` instead, i.e. `pip3 install --user -e .`

Then launch the `gym-duckietown-server` container in the background:

    docker run -tid -p 8902:8902 -p 5558:5558 \
    -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY --name gym-duckietown-server \
    --rm -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix \
    duckietown/gym-duckietown-server

(If you ever want to stop this `server` container, you can use the command `docker container stop gym-duckietown-server` but **DON'T** do this now.)

And now you can the agent on the shell:

    python3 agent.py

And after a second or so, the matplotlib window should pop up and you should see your Duckiebot in action.

## FAQ

#### 1. "It looks like it's stuck / I see output like `sent action: 0 ...` but I don't see the line where it says `The average reward...`. What do?"

Try removing any old `gym-duckietown-server` containers. You can do this by trying out the following commands:


    docker container stop \
    gym-duckietown-agent_gym-duckietown-server_1; \
    docker container rm \
    gym-duckietown-agent_gym-duckietown-server_1

as well as

    docker container stop gym-duckietown-server; \
    docker container rm gym-duckietown-server


#### 2. "I see a lot of lines that read something like `gym-duckietown-server_1  | step_count = 29, reward=-2.018, done = False` but I don't see the line where it says `The average reward...` . What do?"

That's an easy one - the output of your agent is burried under all the console output of the server. That happens sometimes, but not super consistently. To alleviate this, just add `| less` after your `docker-compose up` command like so:


    docker-compose pull && docker-compose up | less

This way all the ouput is piped into the `less` text viewer program and you can scroll through it at your leisure (with the arrow keys). You can close the `less` program by pressing the <kbd>q</kbd> key.


#### 3. "I get the error `Bind for 0.0.0.0:8902 failed: port is already allocated`"

The full error looks something like this:

    Creating gym-duckietown-agent_gym-duckietown-server_1 ... error

    ERROR: for gym-duckietown-agent_gym-duckietown-server_1  Cannot start service gym-duckietown-server: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint gym-duckietown-agent_gym-duckietown-server_1 (0dddcea67fab4de58153d323788cc1baced4415c90471fce04fde2c1180273ea): Bind for 0.0.0.0:8902 failed: port is already allocated

    ERROR: for gym-duckietown-server  Cannot start service gym-duckietown-server: driver failed programming external connectivity on endpoint gym-duckietown-agent_gym-duckietown-server_1 (0dddcea67fab4de58153d323788cc1baced4415c90471fce04fde2c1180273ea): Bind for 0.0.0.0:8902 failed: port is already allocated
    ERROR: Encountered errors while bringing up the project.

The problem here is that there is some container or service running that is occupying the same port (probably that's another `gym-duckietown-server` container that hasn't shut down properly). You can fix this by following the same steps as in answer 1.
